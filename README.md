# My Neovim config
## Why
Vim and Neovim can happily share the same configuration, that's true. But since Vim9 and Neovim 0.5 will increasingly diverge, I have decided to respect both.

In other words, my neovim config will rely more on lua while vim sticks to pure VimL (Vim9 script in particular). Thus, they no longer be able to share the same settings any more. 
## What's going on?
I'm learning lua and will gradually use more lua in this repo.
